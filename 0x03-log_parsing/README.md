## LOG PARSING
Log parsing is the process of analyzing and extracting useful information from log files.<br>
Python provides several built-in modules and libraries for log parsing, such as the <mark>logging module</mark>, the <mark>re module</mark> for regular expressions, and third-party libraries such as <mark>pyparsing</mark>, <mark>pygrok</mark>, and <mark>logstash</mark>.<br> These libraries allow developers to efficiently parse log files and extract relevant data, and to perform further analysis and processing as needed.<br>
<h3><strong>Log Files</strong></h3>
<p>Log files are files that contain records of events, messages, or data generated by a computer system, software application, or network device. These records can include information such as errors, warnings, status updates, system events, and user activities.</p>
<strong><em>Examples</em></strong><br>
Examples of log files include <mark>system logs</mark> (such as Windows Event Logs or Linux Syslogs), <mark>application logs</mark> (such as Apache or Nginx access logs), <mark>security logs</mark> (such as firewall logs or authentication logs), and <mark>network logs</mark> (such as DNS logs or packet capture logs).
